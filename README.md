# My Python Portfolio 


This repository contains a collection of my Python projects. Each project demonstrates my skills and experience in different areas of software development.

## Projects

### 1. Maze Solver
**Description:** This project implements a maze-solving algorithm using the A* search technique. The program visualizes the maze and the pathfinding process.

**Usage:** To run the maze solver, navigate to the `project_maze` directory and execute the `maze_solver.py` script.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Matplotlib

More projects will be added soon!
